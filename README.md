# GroupChatBot
A bot that I made for use with my group chat, for educational purposes only

This bot includes a link to a music server /cogs/musiccog.py

Also included are examples of sql database interaction, solutions towards fixing classes after changing the bot format (the addition of bot as an acceptable variable in most rewrote classes, and subclassing the bot to centralize the connection across multiple files)
